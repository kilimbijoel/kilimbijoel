# RNN Practical

## Student Details
- **Name:** Joel Kilimbi  
- **Registration Number:** IN14/00008/21  

## Project Description
This project focuses on the implementation of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for sequence prediction tasks. The model is designed to process sequential data efficiently, demonstrating the practical applications of RNNs in machine learning.

## Features
- Implementation of an RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training and evaluation on a dataset for sequence prediction.
- Visualization of model performance with accuracy and loss graphs.
- Easy-to-run Google Colab notebook.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the `RNN_Practical.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run all cells to train and test the RNN model.
4. View performance metrics and results.

## Repository Contents
- `RNN_Practical.ipynb` - Main notebook file.
